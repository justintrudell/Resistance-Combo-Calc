#Resistance Combo Calculator
This is a small Python script which was developed to help with circuits labs throughout my undergraduate degree. 

It simply takes as input the resistors you have on hand (either by inputting their values directly or their colour bands), as well as a desired final value. It then calculates the possible parallel/series combinations you can use to achieve the desired resistance. This is useful when you don't immediately have the correct resistor on hand that you need, but have many other resistors with various values.
